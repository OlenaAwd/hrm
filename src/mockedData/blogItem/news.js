    subTitle: "Six Reasons Why People Relocate Houses?",
    text: `<p>House relocation is the housing industries best kept secret. Many know about ‘house relocation’, few know why people do it or how to do it.</p></br> <p>House removal and relocation isn’t a new practice. Since the early 1800s there have been countless methods used to relocate an existing house to a new location. It is one of the oldest forms of recycling in the world. And it was a favoured option of the lower to middle class families of the 1900’s when it was less expensive to pack the house up and move it, rather than building a new home.</p></br><p>Today in fact, house relocation continues to be an inexpensive way to get a house.  Rather than building a house from scratch, with all the delays and design worries that can bring, or compromising on what you want and building an off the plan shoe box, you can have a gorgeous home with loads of space, period features, renovated kitchens and bathrooms for relatively very little cost.</p></br><p>The main reason why most people relocate a house is to save money by entering the house market at a cheap price point and making money, either through equity or profit if/when you sell your relocated property.</p></br>`,
    text2:
      "<p>There are literally hundreds of other benefits to house relocation. Rather than listing them all here, here are some of the other key reasons why people relocate a house as opposed to other housing alternatives.</p><br><p>Relocating a house provides you with potential for the future, it plays a part in preserving and protecting our architectural history, house relocation is kinder to the environment and our personal preferences are changing.  Many of us are no longer happy to chained up to a 30 years mortgage.  There is a real shift with people wanting to pay down their mortgage quickly to give them financial freedom and a sense of personal achievement.</p></br><p>House relocation appeals to all generations, no matter where you are, in life’s journey.</p></br><p>Here are six primary motivations for people setting out on the adventure of relocating a house:</p><br/><ol><li><p>You are wanting to put a home on your land as cheaply as possible. When it comes to buying your first home, house relocation offers you the potential to get a house cheap.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps you are wanting to get a holiday house on a block in the country or at the beach, as cheaply as possible? Rather than paying a lot of money for a dwelling you will not use full time, relocating a house onto land gives you a dwelling to enjoy without a large financial investment.</p></li><li><p>You would like to take the 1st step towards building a property portfolio. Relocating a house to generate immediate equity, to help you secure other properties, is an affordable and realistic option, to get you started.</p></li><li><p>You are wanting to prioritise your land – to get the best size, location and surroundings possible – and therefore needing to minimise the cost of getting a house on that land</p></li><li><p>You might already own a block of land that is failing to see – by relocating a house onto your land, you will not only increase the value of your property, but also make it more appealing to a broader range of potential buyers.</p></li><li><p>You want a genuine period house on your block on land.  Let’s face it, it’s simply not possible to build a new house that really has the space (think wide hallways, high ceilings) and genuine features (hand crafted stainless windows and solid wooden doors) of a period house – think of Queenslanders, Colonials and even Workers Cottages.</p></li></ol><p>Relocating a house can be a stressful and complex process.It is essential that you understand what is required from start to finish and how to plan your house relocation for success.Not understanding the process will result in time and money delays, some very expensive.</p></br > <p>Relocating a house onto an existing block of land can be a worthwhile undertaking where you control how much or how little time and effort you put in to your project.  By sourcing a modest size home that is fully or partially renovated, or even un-renovated but in reasonable condition, you can live in your own home for a while and when circumstances are right (and you can afford it!), you can renovate and develop it to suit your own particular needs.</p></br><p>You might want to add extra rooms and living spaces, add another level or perhaps build outside entertaining spaces or a pool, if or when your budget stretches that far! Whatever you do with your very own house relocation project, the benefits can be huge.</p></br>",
    text3:
      "<p>As with anything in life, there are downside and risks to relocating a house. However, the rewards can be enormous, not just financially but also personally and for your future lifestyle.</p></br><p>If you have limited financial capacity or wish to kick off an investment portfolio, house relocation offers benefits to everyone.</p></br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?

      "Should you employ a Builder or a Carpenter for your house relocation?",
    text: "<p>I often get asked, is it better to employ a builder or a carpenter to undertake renovations and repairs on a house that has been relocated.</p></br><p>Inexperienced house renovators and relocators often think that a carpenter and builder are the same. Technically they are both ‘builders’ and people tend to use the word interchangeable. But there are some really important differences you must be aware of, when scoping your house relocation trades.</p></br><p>So, what is the difference between a builder and a carpenter? In very general terms, a carpenter builds the woodwork of a structure and is contracted by a builder who supervises their work. A builder might be contracted by a business owner or architect, or work for themselves.</p></br><p>A builder will oversee the entire process of your house relocation project, if you choose not to be an owner builder. They will supervise, coordinate and work on your house, excavating, demolishing and renovating your home. They will manage your projects tradespeople from cabinet makers, to water proofers, to tilers, to plasterers and painters, to electrician and plumbers. They will order materials, co-ordinate and management paperwork and compliance matters, attend site inspections with relevant authorities and solve problems and issues that pop up.</p></br><p>As opposed to a carpenter who will construct, erect, install, renovate and repair structures and fixtures on your relocated house. They work with a variety of materials such as wood, plywood, wallboard and other building materials. Some of the work they could undertake on your project includes; installing new windows and doors, repairing floor structures, installing skylights, building staircases and building pergolas, carports and decks.</p></br>",
    text2:
      "<p>Building regulations and legislation for builders and carpenters vary from state to state and territories across Australia.</p></br><p>So, you need to thoroughly understand what regulations and apply to the state you will be relocating a house in, because employing the incorrect tradesperson to work on your relocation project, can cost you time, delays and money. And ultimately could prevent you from legally moving into your newly relocated home.</p></br><p>One of the quickest and easiest ways to find out if your carpenter or builder are licensed and qualified to carry out the work you wish to hire them to do, is to ask to see their registration card.</p></br><p>A registration card lists the what work they are legally permitted to undertake. Licenses in all states and territories across Australia, clearly state what work they are qualified to do for you.  These licenses have to be renewed (just like a driver’s license) periodically (every 3 years).</p></br><p>So, before you engage a carpenter or builder, make sure their license is current.</p></br><p>When scoping your project, you will need to make lots of decisions and one of these will be around employing a builder or a carpenter. This decision will be dependent on your budget, how much or how little work your project requires and also how much of the work you are planning on undertaking yourself.</p></br><p>Once you have made these decisions, you can start to engage potential tradespeople.</p></br><p>Generally speaking, you need to ask some basic project management questions to a potential builder/carpenter you are considering hiring.  Whilst these questions may seem obvious, I have lost count of the horror stories I have heard, from people who have mismanaged their builders and carpenters and tradespeople in general.</p></br><p>Here are some areas and questions you need to ask, before engaging a builder/carpenter for your house relocation project.</p></br>",
    text3:
      "<p><b>Previous Experience</b> - Have they worked on a house relocate before? If yes, ask to see their work and speak to previous customers.</p></br><p><b>Level of Interest</b> - Would they be interested to work on your house relocation? I have come across a few builders and carpenters over the year, who don’t want to work on house relocations. It’s always best to be upfront, than have a tradesperson who isn’t fully engaged in his/her work.</p></br><p><b>Your project</b> - What is the scope and size of your project. Is this a project they wish to work on? Do they need to sub-contract to other tradespeople?</p></br><p><b>Costs</b> - What are the costs associated with your proposed project? What budget do you have available? Will they provide an itemised and detailed quote? How much they charge? And what is included? What is their material markup percentage?  How will you pay them? What costs/expenses have not been included in your quote?</p></br><p><b>Availability</b> - Are they available when you need the work done? Many tradespeople need to be booked weeks and months in advance.  Can you work to your estimated project timeframe?</p></br><p><b>Insurances</b> - Are they adequately insured?  Are their policies current? Can they make these available to you?</p></br><p><b>Dispute resolution</b> - How will you manage any potential disputes? Are they approachable and easy to communicate with? Can they be available onsite to meet you for progress updates and to resolve issues? </p></br><p><b>Quality</b> - Do they guarantee their work? How will they work with you to rectify any problems with their work?</p></br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?

    text: "<p>Relocating a house into a bushfire rated zone is a topic that frequently comes up when I am speaking to people who are considering relocating a house to a new location.</p></br><p>This is an area of great importance for anyone relocating a house and if you are planning to relocate a house, you need to be familiar with this area of regulation.</p></br><p>You need to have a thorough understanding of what a bushfire prone area is and how it can influence what you relocate and where you relocate it too.</p></br><p>A building that is being relocated to a new site that will be in a bushfire prone area, is to be treated as a new build.  You will need to make sure your relocated home is fully compliant with bushfire prone areas provisions in your state and shire. Your relocated house, should not be treated as if it were an existing building on that site.</p></br><p>Bush fire prone land is land that has been identified by the authorities which can support a bush fire or is subject to bush fire attack.  To find out if your land is bush fire prone, you will need to contact the relevant Council or Government agency where the land is located, to ask the question.</p></br>",
    text2:
      "<p>Relocating a house into a bushfire prone area can pose a series of challenges.</p></br><p>If you considering relocating a house into a bushfire prone area, you need to look for a suitable site, consider what materials and the type of house you might relocate. You need to ensure you have access to water resources for firefighting purposes and you have the ability to manage the vegetation on your site. You also need to ensure any potential site has adequate and most importantly clear emergency for emergency vehicles.</p></br><p>Under the Australian Standard for the Construction of Buildings in Bushfire Prone Areas a Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) is a method used to assess and measure the likelihood for a building to be impacted to ember attack, radiant heat and direct flame contact.</p></br><p>There are 6 BAL levels. A building with a high BAL will require much higher construction specifications than a building with a lower level of bushfire attack.</p></br><p>The BAL levels establish the legal requirements you must use when building to ensure your house is protection at the highest possible level, from attack by bushfire.  Before you purchase land or acquire a house to relocate, an assessment of any land you are considering and any potential houses you are considering relocating need to be undertaken.</p></br><p><b>So, how do you find out the BAL for your property?</b></p></br><p>To find out the BAL for your property, you will need to have a bushfire hazard assessment undertaken. Your building surveyor who you will engage for your permits, is best placed to undertake this assessment for you.</p></br><p>Expiry dates are published in BAL certificates. They usually expire within 12 months, so be aware of this as you plan your house relocation.</p></br>",
    text3:
      "<p><b>What are the steps for a BAL assessment?</b></p></br><p>There are the steps your building surveyor may follow when assessing your properties BAL.</p></br><ul><li>Assessing the applicable fire danger index in the area you are considering relocating a house too</li><li>Assessing the vegetation types within 100m in all directions from your proposed house relocation site.</li><li>Assessing the distance from your proposed house relocation site, to classified vegetation.</li><li>Assess the slope of your proposed site under the classified vegetation.</li><li>Determine your site BAL, by taking all of the above into consideration.</li></ul><p>Depending on the outcomes of your BAL assessment, you can tailor your house relocation repairs and renovations to ensure they meet all the requirements of your BAL assessment.</p></br><p>You may also get the opportunity to undertake changes to the vegetation on your site to reduce your BAL level.</p></br><p>However, these issues will need to be worked through in detail and clarified with your building surveyor at the time.</p></br><p>Failing to comply with your BAL, can result in your building surveyor being unable to issue you with a final occupancy permit, allowing you to legally reside in your home.</p></br><p>Once you have had your BAL assessment undertaken and worked through the legal requirements, to getting your house relocated, repaired and renovated to meet you BAL level, you need to switch your attention to costing your project.</p></br><p>Relocating a house, repairing it and renovating it, onto a high BAL rated site, will probably be more expensive than relocating a house into a lower-level BAL rated site.  You may also experience time delays as you will need to source to specific construction materials to comply with your BAL.</p></br><p>The risks of relocating a house into a high-level BAL rated site can be too much for some potential house relocators.  If you have a site assessed and you are uncomfortable with the challenges of relocating a house onto that site, keep looking and find a low-level site.</p></br><p>The old adage ‘nothing ventured nothing gained,’ can be applied here. You will have learnt a whole lot about BAL’s, that you can apply to another site and you will have gained a better understanding of what factors you need to consider, when looking for a site to relocate your house too.</p></br><p>Before committing to relocating a house onto a high BAL rated site, do your homework.  Cost the entire scope of work thoroughly and in as much detail as you can. Make sure you have access to suitable tradespeople and most importantly, follow the advice and guidance your building surveyor gives you. Don’t take short cuts, they will only serve to cost you time and extra money in the long. Because complying with BAL ratings is the law.</p></br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?

      "<p>So how do you choose the right house relocation company for you? Similar, to selecting a real estate agent to sell a house for you, use these tips to find out more about a House Removal Company before you engage them to move your home.</p></br><p>Firstly, you need to understand which house relocation companies operate in the State and area, you are considering relocating a home.  There is no point speaking to someone in Victoria, if you are looking at undertaking a Queensland based project.</p></br><p>As a starting point, you will benefit from connecting and engaging with others who have relocated a house.  It is really beneficial speaking to someone who has recently been through the house relocation process about their experiences and recommendations.</p></br><p>Ask them if they would recommend the company, they engaged to move a house again? Ask them if anything went wrong and how the problem was address. Ask them if everything agreed to in the contract of relocation was delivered? And if not, why and how was it resolved? Also ask questions regarding the quality of work? And also, if they found it was easy to communicate with their relocation company.</p></br><p>If possible, familiarise yourself with house relocation companies that have relocated properties in your area. Pay attention to the completed dwelling and the standard of finish.  This will give you a good indication of which companies are going to do a great job, relocating your new home.</p></br><p>When contacting house removal companies, my basic rule is that if an email or telephone call are not responded to within 24 hours, then they are not a contractor I wish to work with. To date, this approach has never failed me.</p></br><p>Once you have found a house relocator who has indicated they can re-locate a home in your area, make a time to speak with them on the phone or meet them at a current relocation site if possible and ask them questions.  Some may have available ‘before’ and ‘after’ images of successful relocations they have undertaken. Ask them to walk you through their house relocation processes and have them answer all of your questions.</p></br><p>Develop a short list of preferred House Removal Companies. Narrow down your list to two companies and ask them for a detailed time line and costs.  The cheapest quote is not necessarily the best, remember these people will be transporting your much-loved future family home, on the back of a truck!</p></br><p>Ask questions! Make sure that you are completely comfortable with the house relocation process and if you are unsure, or do not know – ASK! Make sure you can easily contact your chosen contractor throughout the process.  The last thing you need is to be leaving telephone messages that go unanswered!</p></br>",
    text3:
      "<p>Do you feel comfortable with the House Removalist?  You will at times need to be very honest with him/her during the relocation process. So, you need to make sure you are comfortable with them and can open and honest communication.</p></br><p>Ask the House Removal Company for feedback. They should keep you updated throughout the relocation process. If your contract contains major payment milestones (most contracts will), ask your contractor to provide you with weekly reports by email – so that you are across the level of progress are aware of delays/issues, to ensure that both parties meet their contractual obligations.</p></br><p>Discuss legal and contractual details when you meet with your short list of Companies.  Ask them to walk you through the detailed costing so you are 100% clear on what is included and what isn’t included as part of the contract. You will also need to understand your responsibilities around payment deadlines.</p></br><p>Check the small print once you have selected your preferred House Removal Company. Make sure you are familiar with the terms of engagement; it is your responsibility to know what you’ve agreed to before signing anything legally binding.</p></br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?

    text: "<p>Relocating a house is a huge project.  It may well be the biggest project some people ever undertake.  And it's essential that you source accurate, ideally written quotes for every significant expenditure!</p></br><p>It’s a given that something will go wrong, especially during the reconstruction step, but things can go wrong and costs can escalate at any point in the project.</p></br><p>So real care needs to be taken at every step.  Make sure that your early rough estimates are always conservative - budgeting too much is always better than budgeting too little. And always make sure you get firm estimates from reliable tradespeople and business who don’t hesitate to provide their quotes in writing and are willing to be specific about when they can do things.  If someone doesn't want to give me a written quote then I'll never give them the job because it’s a sure sign they can't be relied on.</p></br><p>The challenge of budgeting is one of the main reasons some of my clients reach out with hands in the air, frustrated and swearing they will never undertake another project again!</p></br><p>That said, that old adage failure to prepare is preparing to fail, is absolutely true when it comes to budgeting for your house relocation project.  Not even trying to budget, because it feels too difficult or too scary or just too time consuming, could mean you end up spending a lot of money and ending up with a house you can't actually move into.</p></br>",
    text2:
      "<p>Estimating costs is as much an art as it is a science. And the more you do it, the better you’ll get. Just because you haven’t got quotes yet or don’t yet know exactly what something is going to cost doesn’t mean we don’t include a preliminary guestimate in the budget to make sure there will be some money allocated to it.</p></br><p>But, a word of caution. Guessing costs is only a stepping stone to good budgeting, and it’s a pretty wobbly one at that.</p></br><p>Even before you commit to a particular house for your land, some of the costs need to be based on firm quotes - and sooner rather than later all the preliminary guestimates need to be turned into solid estimates too.  And before you have all the estimated costs under control, it’s vital that you are keeping a record of all project expenditure as you go. Knowing where every dollar is being spent is just as important as knowing what still has to be paid for.</p></br><p>If you’re not great with numbers and a novice when it comes to budgeting, now is the time to learn how to budget properly. Sticking to a budget takes willpower. As painful as it may seem, you need to start practicing patience and may need to start saying no to a few luxuries.</p></br><p>So what are the absolute essentials for a successful house relocation budget? First up, you need be specific. Relocating a house is way too big and complex to budget on the back of an envelope!  You need to understand all the work required and where your money will be spent.  Your budget needs to be realistic. You need to work out how much you can REALLY afford.</p></br><p>The greatest challenges you will face is determining how much your house relocation will cost.  This is one of the reasons why it costs a lot of money to hire a builder to do a project for you.  A builder prepares estimates, sources quotes, pays all the project bills and monitors your project budget every day.  To give you a fixed price contract a builder has to factor in a substantial contingency to ensure they profit from a job.</p></br><p>Paying someone else to do all this costs a lot of money, because it involves a lot of work. You CAN do it yourself and save all that money, but ONLY if you commit the time and effort to do the work!</p></br><p>Some of the costs for a house relocation project are clear and unchanging. However other costs are less easy to budget for because they might not be fully apparent from the beginning.</p></br><p>If you are simply going to have a house relocated to an existing piece of land and do just the essential repairs to repair the damage of the house being relocated, your costs are going to be significantly lower – and simpler to estimate and manage - than if you want major renovations as well.</p></br>",

      "<p>Once you embark on your project lots of people will suddenly be telling you how much things cost, what they think you should do, how to do things better and cheaper. My tip to you is to do your own homework.  Thoroughly.  Don’t rely on other people's opinions.  Their experiences might not be at all relevant to your project.  Understand your needs and work towards sourcing as much information as you can and then make a truly informed and accurate decision based in your research.</p></br><p>Please don't let other people influence you to make decisions that you wouldn't necessarily make. Trust your own instincts.  Believe me, decisions made because someone talked you into them are very often regretted down the track and they are more than likely to cost you time and money.  Sadly, I know this is indeed true as I have seen many people caught out several times in the early days of my house relocation journey.</p> </br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?

    text: "<p>When I speak to people about house relocation many of them think it is as simple as loading it onto a truck and driving it to its new site.  Unfortunately, this could not be further from the truth! Removing and relocating a house is a highly complex process.</p></br><p>Relocating a house is a huge project. Things can go wrong and costs can escalate at any point in the project. So real care needs to be taken at every step.</p></br><p>Before embarking on a house relocation project, it’s essential that you have a thorough understanding of the house removal and relocation process.  You need to understand the entire relocation process, to ensure your project is successful with minimal stress and risk. By understanding what is involved from beginning to end, you will know exactly what you committing yourself too.</p></br><p>However, before you embark on your house relocation journey, you need to understand that not all houses can be moved.  Not every available house is suitable for moving.  Substandard houses that are relocated against the advice of professional house relocators, most often result in dissatisfied customers.</p></br>",
    text2:
      "<p>Understanding what is suitable and not suitable for relocation is the first step of many in the relocation process. By not understanding this, potential relocators can cost themselves time and money.</p></br><p>The four most critical mistakes people can make when relocating a house are:</p></br><ul><li>Not knowing where to start</li><li>Not knowing what the end will look like</li><li>Not understanding the whole process</li><li>And not keeping track of time and money while your project is underway.</li></ul><p>Over the years, we have seen people paying deposits on a house for relocation, only to find out the house cannot be relocated for various reasons. So, you need to do your homework, before you start. Just because a property owner/representative says a home can be relocated, don’t take their word, seek out the experts who can advise you if a house is suitable for relocation.</p></br><p>There are some important areas to consider when you are relocating a house.  You need to understand these areas and what steps need to be done, when they need to be done, and how to go about doing them along with all the other things that are needed for a house relocation project.</p></br><p>You need to outline what you want to achieve before you start your project:</p></br><ul><li>Your goals</li><li>Your timeframe</li><li>Your budget</li><li>And what is your dream home?</li></ul><p>It is essential to clearly understand each of these areas and the relevant to specific times of each, in the overall process and involve specific tasks and skills.</p></br><p>You will want to be making decisions that best suit your individual personal and family, financial and lifestyle goals for the future.</p></br><p>You’ll also need to be prepared for when things go wrong. Such as:</p></br><ul><li>Tradespeople who arrive too early or too late</li><li>Unexpected costs from unforeseen circumstances</li><li>Delays to the project, which are out of your control</li><li>Materials that haven’t arrived on time</li><li>And structural or design decisions that no one knew would need to be made until the work actually started.</li></ul><p>Often, we see people get caught up in the excitement of a house relocation project, with many believing it can be an easy way to get a house. You need to understand the five most common pitfalls people make when relocating a house.</p></br>",
    text3:
      "<p><b>1. Budget Blowout</b></p></br><p>Every house relocation project experiences financial challenges. However, there are two main areas you need to address to ensure your budget does not blow out.  The first reason is poor quality briefings.  Make sure you provide as much detail as you can to your tradespeople and seek written quotes. Avoid hourly arrangements with uncapped rates. And the second reason is unforeseen expenses, leading to budget blowouts.  If you have an adequate contingency, you can use these funds to address reasonable unforeseen expenses without them impacting on your project. So never start a hose relocation project, without have a contingency of at least 20% of the total budget.</p></br><p><b>2. Communication challenges</b></p></br><p>Poor quality or lack of communication can result in unnecessary time and money delays.  You need to feel comfortable with the tradespeople you are employing, if you want to keep your project on budget and completed within your timeframe. You also need to ensure that you understand exactly what is and is not included in quotes (scope of work) and everyone’s responsibilities.</p></br><p><b>3. Lack of planning</b></p></br><p>There are hundreds of elements to house relocation, so thorough and detailed planning is crucial. You need to start planning well before your house relocation project starts and ensure you continue this process throughout your relocation project. You need to ensure you understand the order of work required, what is required, roles and responsibilities from the start to the end of your project.</p></br><p><b>4. Time pressures</b></p></br><p>People often launch head first into a house relocation project, with unrealistic time expectations.  So often people who relocate a house, think it is as simple as cutting up a house, relocating it to a new site and putting it back together. House relocation is not as simple as that. You must build realistic flexibility into your house relocation timeline.  If you are time poor, don’t take unnecessary and expensive short cuts. If you want a quality house at the end, take the time to realise your dreams.</p></br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?

However, the absolute number one advantage of relocating a house is that it helps to reduce pollution and conserve resources.</p></br><p>When you relocate a house sustainably through house relocation and you then renovate that house to become a sustainable home, you are helping to preserve our planet. All because you are reducing pollution and conserving resources.</p></br>",

      "<p>House relocation reduces carbon emissions. It gives you the opportunity to invest in green energy for your new home. It feeds into the circular economy. It plays a role in environmental conservation and assists with water conservation. It also provides you with an opportunity to become energy efficient.</p></br><p>Renovating a newly relocate house, reduces the embodied energy of a building by extending its life and provides the ultimate opportunity for renovators to incorporate environmentally sustainable products and functionality to the home.  Simple things like investing in energy efficient light bulbs, using water based paints and installing a smart meter are well publicised sustainability tactics. Before you relocate a house, you need to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the houses current sustainability footprint (or lack thereof) and spend time identifying, researching and planning what level of sustainability you want to achieve for your home.</p></br><p>Relocating a house allows you to make adjustments to your floorplan to achieve a more passive design; greater insulation, improve windows, and utilise as many sustainable materials and appliances in the renovation of your home.</p></br><p>So, what are some of the benefits of living in a sustainably relocated house? Your new home will require less energy to heat it and cool it and sustainably compliant houses offer more comfort for their residents.  A sustainable house will be more resilient to climate and weather extremes, which are sadly becoming the norm these days.  In addition to these, it will improve your mental health, reduce your personal landfill footprint, protect the biodiversity in your environment and you will save money on your monthly bills.</p></br><p>Let’s take a look at some of the ways you can incorporate sustainability into your house relocation project.</p></br>",
    text3: `<span><b>Invest in Green Energy</b></span></br><p>When you a planning to relocate a house, it is a great opportunity to plan for green energy and the opportunities your new home presents to generate it. Installing solar panels and generating electricity can be a terrific long term financial investment - think zero energy bills.</p></br><span><b>Insulate, Insulate, Insulate!</b></span><p>Firstly, choose the highest-quality insulation you can afford. This is an essential way to protect you from Australia’s extreme weather. If your house has poor insulation or no insulation as a lot of older houses don’t, you will be uncomfortable living in your new house during hot summer months and some winter, expect to receive some hefty heating bills.</p></br><p>Furthermore, ensuring your roof is thoroughly insulated with quality insulation, will ensure you save some money on energy bills in the future and will also help you reduce your carbon footprints.</p></br><span><b>Heating System</b></span></br><p>Nearly all relocated houses will require additional heating, especially during the cold seasons. Rather than turning to traditional heating methods, a more sustainable alternative to consider is a ground-source heat pump.</p></br><p>Put simply, pipes are buried under your home (or in your garden) and the pipes extract heat from the earth, providing you with heating for your new home and water.</p></br><p>Roof cavity heating systems are also an option. They heat the home, extracting heat from the air. They are usually fitted in the roof space, making them ideal for houses that are relocated.</p></br><span><b>Floor repairs</b></span><p>Floors get damaged and need to be repaired once a house is relocated.  There are plenty of eco-friendly flooring options available and they are becoming more popular. If, however you have relocated a house with original wooden boards, source and use matching recycled boards as they will not warp once they are installed if installed correctly.</p></br><span><b>Repurpose & Reuse</b></span><p>An experienced house relocator knows all tricks of the trade, when it comes to repurposing, reusing and recycling every inch of their new home.  Before relocating a house take a walk around the site it is being moved from and see what can be salvaged and re-purposed at the new site.</p></br><p>For example, bricks from an outdoor barbeque at the old site, could be repurposed into garden edging at the new house.   Another great option to consider is re-using building materials into other areas of your new home. For example, an old character filled garden shed door, could be repurposed into a desk.</p></br><p>And a tip, don’t demolish and throw out items without truly thinking about there potential to be re-used.  This will avoid you having to go out and buy new lesser quality items.</p></br><p>You might also consider a buy, swap and sell platform, to re-home unwanted building items is a terrific example of the circular economy.  You will be helping another human being and helping the environment.<p></br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?

      "<p>Setting a budget for your house relocation is vitally important.  I know one couple who neglected their budget plan and bought a house for $1 but it ended up costing them more than $250,000 before they could move in….. three years later.</p></br><p>Each house relocation project creates its own challenges, some of them time and money consuming.  The biggest variable in any house removal and relocation project, is the amount of work required to get your house compliant to regulatory standards, so that you can legally live in it.</p></br><p>It is not easy and there are no hard and fast ways to relocating a house cheap.  This is not something you can outsource to someone from start to end, to do it for you. Paying someone else to do all this costs a lot of money, because it involves a lot of work.</p></br><p>This is one of the reasons why it costs a lot of money to hire a builder to do the project for you. The builder would be doing all the estimates, getting all the quotes, paying all the bills and monitoring the budget every day.

With hard work from yourself and determination it is only something that you can personally achieve.</p></br><p>You CAN do it yourself and save all that money, but ONLY if you commit the time and effort to do the work!</p></br><p>Some of the costs for your project will be clear and unchanging, like the purchase price for your land and the house that you’re going to relocate.  And you’ll know from very early on about lots of things that are either missing or unsuitable for reuse when the house is relocated, like doors and taps. However other costs are less easy to budget for because they might not be fully apparent from the beginning.</p></br><p>If you're simply going to have a house relocated to an existing piece of land and do just the essential repairs to repair the damage of the house being relocated, your costs are going to be significantly lower – and simpler to estimate and manage - than if you want major renovations as well.</p></br><p>For a house relocation project to be successful you firstly need to be realistic about what type of house you want to relocate and secondly, be realistic about what you can afford. Thirdly you need to budget for unexpected costs as every single house relocation will end up having costs that no one could have foreseen.</p></br><p>There is absolutely nothing stopping YOU, from getting a house for under $100,000. The two things stopping you are your determination and willingness to do whatever it takes.  Take it from me removing and relocating a house never gets easier. You simply become wiser and know how to make great decisions, sometimes under financial and time pressures.</p></br><p>Over the years I’ve learnt lots of ways to streamline the process when relocating a house.  I have learnt hundreds of money and time saving techniques, that have stretch my budget further than I could have imagines.</p></br>",

    text: "<p>Often, we I am speaking to people who are wanting to relocate a house onto a rural block of land, we get talking about septic tanks and how they apply to a house being relocated.</p></br><p>So, for those of you who are unfamiliar with septic tanks, let me explain a little about how they work.  For a home not connected to the mains sewage network septic tanks are required to ensure a safe disposal of wastewater. A septic tank works by collecting raw sewage and wastewater in a large underground tank.  Septic tanks are more predominant in rural areas.</p></br><p>A septic tank can be used to treat the sewage from individual building.  The sewage will pass through sewer pipes to the septic tank. The septic tank is a sealed round or rectangular container which is used to break down the sewage so that it becomes effluent through the action of bacteria living on the waste matter.</p></br><p>It can be tough for someone planning to relocate a home to a rural area, to predict what the cost to install a septic tank will be to their project.   Your first step should be to contact a reputable professional who can help you determine what will work best for your home and who can tell you what your project will cost.  You will also need to ensure that you have the relevant permits for installing a septic system on your land.</p></br><p>Under the Environment Protection Act 2017, you will need to obtain a permit from your local council or shore prior to the installation or alteration of a septic system. Heavy penalties apply if you carry out works without out without a permit. If you are considering relocating a house, its always best to reach out to your local council and have them explain what permits will</p></br>",
    text2:
      "<p>In addition to your permits, the Environment Protection Regulations (EPA) 2021 require owners of septic systems to keep and hold all records of maintenance activities carried out on their septic system. Again, do your homework and make sure you are aware of your responsibilities.</p></br><p>And if you are unfamiliar with a septic system, you need to learn the do's and don'ts of a septic tank and how to maintain your septic system. Is a septic tank gets blocked or malfunctions down the track, it can not only be messy but very expensive to repair.</p></br><p>Factors that will impact the cost of your septic system include the size of the tank you require, the bigger the tank the higher the price and the amount of preparation at the site, if required. This includes the amount of excavation and associated digging that needs to be done to prepare the site for installation. A system that requires a fair amount of excavation work, can really impact your budget.</p></br><p>Once you have spoken to a qualified professional, the cost to install a septic tank will mostly depend on the type of tank you choose as well as your professional.</p></br>",

      "<p>In addition, if you think you might make changes to the floorplan of the house you are relocating by demolishing internal walls, you will be impacting the internal integrity (read structure) of your house. Never ever demolish walls or structures, before seeking the professional advice of a qualified building professional as you won’t know if the wall contains plumbing and/or wiring infrastructure in it.</p> </br><p>If you are an inexperienced renovator the structural costs whilst necessary, do not add to the aesthetic appeal to your new home.

    text: "<p>Relocating a house is the building industries best kept secret, few know about and the huge benefits that come with relocating a house. It can create wealth; it can be a quick housing alternative that sees you moving into your new home much sooner. It has the potential to reduce your mortgage by 20 years. And it can make you some serious money – think immediate equity and profit if you sell.  Relocating a house has the potential to make you hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit. But only if you know what you are doing.</p></br><p>Building a house from scratch can cause many headaches. From unexpected delays, unrealistic price increases for no extra benefit and design limitations, you can end up with a home you are not entirely happy in, with a huge mortgage and located in a new estate that lacks amenity.</p></br><p>Compare this to house relocation where you get more choice, more space and more value. There are no gimmicks with house relocation. There are no price freezes, no fancy marketing tactics, no crazy lock in contracts with pages of fine print conditions you can’t understand.  And you get free upgrades, that you are paying for!</p></br>",

      "<p>The main reason why people relocate a house is to save money and make money, it’s that simple. If you choose the right home and the right relocation company and you know exactly what you are doing, you can save heaps of money.</p></br><p>The number one questions I am asked is “how much money can be saved by relocating a house compared to building a new home from scratch?”  This is a difficult question to answer as know two house relocation projects are the same, it is hard to provide solid figures in an article like this.</p></br><p>Estimates vary, from somewhere between 30 – 50% compared to a new home build, without compromising on location, space and quality. With the cost of building materials sky rocketing over the last few years, it has never been more important to ensure you are getting absolute value for your hard-earned money.</p></br><p>Many of the homes we see before they are relocated have been partially or extensively renovated, so much of the hard work has been done for you!  These houses have great ‘bones’, flexible floorplans and loads of space.  In addition to saving, you money, many houses come with stunning period detailing and craftsmanship, which is very difficult and extremely expensive to replicate.  For example, homes available for relocation can include leadlight doors and windows, ornate cornices and architraves, ceiling roses, hallway arches, antique light fittings, cast iron fireplaces with fret work and ornate mantles.</p></br><p>And of course you'll be able to walk around the house before you choose it - stretch out your arms to measure the space of each room, work out where your furniture will go... it’s so much easier to get a feel for how you will live in it than trying to imagine 3d spaces from flat scaled down 2d drawings for a house that hasn't been built yet.</p></br><p>So, you’ll know exactly what you’re getting – in terms of the materials your house is made of, exactly where the windows and doors are, and where the light switches and the kitchen sink are located.  You can change things later if you like, but there won’t be any surprises.</p></br><p>The best bit about relocating a house is that you get to choose, where you relocate your house.  Think large blocks of land in premium growth areas, with wide streets, established gardens and trees and mature communities. Locations you thought were out of your reach due to financial considerations.  Or you might already own the house you love but want to live in a different location - to have more space, more peace and quiet, or to be closer to the people you love.</p></br>",

      "<p>The benefits to house relocation are great. Let’s look at some more</p></br><ol><li><b>Time</b> – Why wait months or years for a build or new purchase. Move into a relocated house sooner. </li><li><b>Future proof</b> – Relocate a house onto a large block of land. Plan for future. Spending only what you are comfortable spending now. Plan to expand down the track, when your life allows.</li><li><b>Preservation of our history</b> – Help preserve Australia’s architectural heritage.  Create a home that is unique to your style and suburb. Who wants to live in a home that looks like all the others in the street and greater suburb</li><li><b>Helping the environment</b> - Recycling the timber components of a house has a significant environmental benefit, saving tress as well as the energy required to cut, mill and transport the wood.  Relocating a house instead of demolishing it also means less land fill.</li></ol><p>Relocating a house means you can start with a viable, habitable, fully functioning house, then expand and modify it later as your budget and requirements change.  You will be giving an old, unwanted, discarded house a new lease on life and a whole new set of memories, if only those walls could talk!</p></br><p>There are many ways of creating a place to call home.  But recycling an old unwanted house by relocating it – giving an old house a new home - is innovative, environmentally friendly, cost effective, and possibly the most personally satisfying method of creating a place to call home that any of us could achieve.</p></br><p>Want to learn more about House Relocation?
