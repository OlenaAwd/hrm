    urlText: `<p>Hi Everyone, my name is Simone and I am the founder of House Relocation Marketplace.</p><br /><p>Upcycling a kitchen is a great place to save money, when you are relocating a house.</p><br /><p>We all know that renovating or replacing a kitchen can be an expensive job, so if your new kitchen is looking a little worse for wear but you do not want to splash out on a new one, there are heaps of ways to create a beautiful budget friendly kitchen.</p><br/><p>Upcycling essentially helps you achieve two of the 3 'R's of recycling: REDUCE and REUSE. It helps you reduce what is going to landfill, and reuses the product you were going to throw away, giving it a second life.</p><br/><p>There are hundreds of ways to renovate your kitchen when you relocate a house.  Many house relocators choose to paint and update their cabinets instead of replacing them to give them a brand-new look and open kitchen shelving is an emerging trend in the kitchen space right now, with many people choosing to display their kitchen items.</p><br/><p>So please join us in late 2023 as we discuss all things kitchens when you are preparing to or thinking about relocating a house.</p><br/><ul><b>In the podcast we will answer your questions, such as</b><li>How do you know if a kitchen is good to recycle</li><li>How to Do it Yourself</li><li>How to find a kitchen for recycling?</li><li>AND</li><li>What kitchen is right for my family?</li></ul><br/><p>House Relocation Marketplace has partnered with some of Australia’s leading designers and up cyclers to bring you the very best advice to help you when you are assessing the kitchen in the house you plan to relocate.
