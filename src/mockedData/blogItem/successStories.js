The low-cost financial commitment was really attractive to us and we didn’t want to have a huge mortgage,” said Sarah.</p></br><p>“So, we joined House Relocation Marketplace and through the self-paced online training program, we learnt everything they needed to know from start to finish to successfully relocate our house,” said Richard.</p>",

      "<p>“It was really helpful that we could go back and watch modules as we needed, during our house relocation.  The training manual and support materials made the impossible, possible,” said Sarah.</p></br><p>“Especially when we were dealing with permits and managing two building sites. That was a particularly tricky time, so being able to re-watch modules and ask questions in ‘real time’ helped make our house relocation less stressful.”</p></br><p>“Finding a house for free on the House Relocation Marketplace, saved us a lot of time. And having access to the online community for peer support and to have our questions answered almost immediately, was invaluable. That community members advice saved us thousands of dollars in time and helped us make the right decisions.”</p>",
    text3:
      "<p>“Knowing we have the support of the House Relocation Marketplace community behind us and sharing our challenges and achievements with others going through the house relocation process, made our journey easier.”</p></br><p>“It made such a difference being able to tap into the online community and Simone was so helpful. She is full of amazing advice and happy to answers questions, to ensure everyone’s project was successful.”</p></br><p>“We made over $200,000 in equity on our first house relocation and we have ended up with a much bigger house in a better location than we could have dreamed,” said Sarah.</p></br><p>“Another house relocation is definitely in our plans for the future,” said Richard.</p>",

      "<p>“It wasn’t a position I ever thought I would find myself in. After the financial settlement I didn’t have enough money to buy a house, so I started looking at small two-bedroom apartments. It was a shock how small they were and they didn’t have much of a garden. I love gardening so a garden was a must.”</p></br><p>“A friend mentioned house relocation and whilst I had heard of the concept, I didn’t know much about it.  So, I did some research, found House Relocation Marketplace, joined as a member and began looking for a house to relocate.”</p></br><p>“Within two weeks I had fallen in love with a beautiful three-bedroom, Californian bungalow advertised on House Relocation Marketplace.  I negotiated with the owner to place a hold on the house to allow me time to find somewhere to relocate it to. After a 3 week search, I found a suitable block of land to relocate my home to.</p></br><p>I could not believe I had found a house that was big enough to allow my children and grand children to visit me and stay. Sure, it needed some work, but that was not going to stop me!”</p></br><p>“Yeah, it was scary, but I knew that despite the setback of my marriage breaking down, I had a second chance to own my own home and nothing was going to stop me.”</p>",

      "<p>“Twelve months on, I have never been happier. I am slowly making cosmetic changes to my new home.  I have been working on my new garden and when my grandchildren visit, they love running around the background chasing butterfly’s. And sitting on my veranda is my favourite place to enjoy my morning cup of tea.”</p></br><p>“I still cannot believe that I have created this beautiful home for the cost of an apartment! My dreams have come true and it is all thanks to House Relocation Marketplace.</p></br><p>Without the access to Simone’s training, her expert advice and readiness to answer my questions and the supportive online community, my second chance in home ownership would still be a dream.”</p>",

We have both been working full time jobs and casual/part time jobs in the hope that we could save enough money to buy a family home,” said Jamie.</p></br><p>“Despite long hours and sacrificing family holidays and spending time together, we haven’t been able to realise our dream of home ownership.

We were hesitant at first as we knew nothing about it, but we soon realised that relocating a house could help us achieve our dream.” Said Jamie.</p></br><p>“House relocation alleviated so many barriers for us. It was quick, in-expensive compared to other housing options and the training we got from House Relocation Marketplace made our dream possible.”</p></br><p>“After discovering house relocation and the unbelievable opportunity it offered our family, we decided to really evaluate our lives and what our properties were. We realised that it was possible to relocate a house, have a manageable mortgage and still be able to send time together as a family,” said Fleur.</p>",

      "<p>“We looked into the State Government programs and incentives to relocate to a rural location and discovered that not only were there fantastic employment opportunities, there was also the real possibility of a much better work/life balance.”</p></br><p>“So, we threw ourselves into finding some land and a house to relocate. House Relocation Marketplace help us so much. We found a large house to relocate onto an amazing acre of land one hour from the city. We tapped into the services available and we both found amazing jobs to provided us with the balance we craved,” said Fleur.</p></br><p>“Relocating a house with the help of House Relocation Marketplace is the best thing we have done. We have a home we could never have afforded in the city and we spend the weekends and evenings as a family,” said Jamie.</p></br><p>“Relocating a house has saved us a minimum of $200,000 and we will have our mortgage paid off in 12 years,” said Fleur.</p>",

I regularly attended open house weekends that showcased sustainable houses, and was shocked to learn that people were spending as much as $800,000 building a sustainable home. That was way out of my budget.</p></br><p>After searching House Relocation Marketplace, I found a gorgeous cottage to relocate. I made a conscious decision to relocate a smaller property as it costs less and to re-direct my funding to ensuring my new home was fully sustainable,” said Michelle</p>",

Particularly as I am nearing retirement age.”</p></br><p>“I spent a lot of time planning my sustainable renovation and ensuring that I could afford the works required.  After I relocated the cottage, I did the immediate necessary works such as solar panels, heat pump installation and other sustainability works.”</p></br><p>“I am slowly implementing my sustainability works and being financially responsible to make to make I can achieve my end goal.
